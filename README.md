# Coevolution

Coevolution is an open source role-playing system. The basic rules fit on a page and can be learned in 5 minutes, but they are designed to generate varied emergent gameplay that rewards creativity. It's currently being developed and alpha tested. Ideas, feedback, experience reports, and contributions are most welcome!
