# Coevolution: a role-playing system

This document describes Coevolution, a role-playing system. The basic rules fit on a page and can be learned in 5 minutes, but are designed to generate varied emergent gameplay that rewards creativity. The system is generic and can be adapted to a variety of settings (fantasy, cyberpunk, space opera...), but for this writeup we'll describe the rules using a fantasy universe. See notes at the end for applying Coevolution to other universes.

_Coevolution is currently being alpha-tested. Feedback, ideas, and contributions are encouraged!_

In Coevolution, like other role-playing systems, players assume the roles of fictional characters in an imaginary world. A gamemaster (GM) narrates events in this world, players ask questions and decide how they'd like to respond, and outcomes of player actions are determined according to rules (or GM judgement, in situations where the rules don't specify). For instance, here's a short segment from a session:

> Ned and Kaitlyn (the players) are mages on contract from a mysterious client to steal an artifact believed to be held in the vaults underneath the manor of a local minister. The two thieves aren't sure what the artifact is and have some questions about the client, but the client made them an offer they couldn't refuse: if they return with the artifact (a green crystal of some sort), they'll be given an hour of access to a legendary spellbook.
>
> GM: As you continue along the dark passageway, you notice the path ahead makes a left turn. A soft purple light is coming from around the corner. What would you like to do?
>
> Ned: Oooh, that could be the entrance to the vault we were told about.
>
> Kaitlyn: Hmm, there might be a guard. Can we just poke our head around the corner and take a look?
>
> GM: You could try that... but I'll say that if there's someone nearby who happens to be looking in that direction, they'll detect you on with 50/50 odds and we'll roll for it. What would you like to do?

In more time-sensitive situations, such as combat, the gameplay is more structured and relies more on Coevolution's small set of rules, introduced next.

<a id="rules"></a>
## The rules

You can prepare up to 5 spells and hold 2 items, one in each hand. Items in your hands and prepared spells are ready for immediate use. In your pack, you always keep a spell book and up to 25 tiny items (marble sized) and 5 small items (can be held in one hand). Items in your pack can be fetched in a single turn, and you can take a turn to prepare a spell you know (details below). The limits on prepared spells and items, and the time required to fetch other items or prepare other spells generates some of the interesting player decisionmaking in this system, especially during time-sensitive situations such as combat or in planning before combat begins.

While adventuring, you‚Äôll find artifacts (such as spell scrolls or other spell books) that describe specific spells and how to cast them. You can use 5 minutes to record a spell into your spell book from an artifact. A recorded spell can't be cast yet. It must first be _learned_, and then _prepared_. Each night, you can learn up to 3 spells from your spell book. Over time, you can learn any number of spells, but for every 5 spells you learn, you must choose to forget 1 (it can be relearned from its recorded form). This encourages some character specialization without making decisions permanent.

During combat or other time-sensitive situations (which the GM will make clear), you can move a short distance and do one of the following:

* Cast one of your prepared spells.
* Use any item you hold.
* Concentrate to prepare a single spell that you already know. If you already have 5 spells prepared, choose one to unprepare.
* Take an item from your pack and hold it in a free hand, or swap the item in one hand for an item in your pack.

These actions take a few seconds of in-world time. When it matters, distances to some position are kept abstract and described in terms of the number of turns it would require to reach that position. ("The door to the next room is a medium distance away from you; it will take two turns to get there. Do you want to run for it or stand and fight?") For more structured situations like combat, a grid is sometimes used to keep track of positions and distances.

Outside of time sensitive situations, you can move and take actions more freely.

All entities have at most 5 hit points. Some spells do damage. Others heal. Once you reach 0 hit points, your character either dies or becomes unconscious (unconscious if a d20 roll is 7 or greater, dead otherwise). Once unconscious, you can't be further hurt and can only be revived by another party member using a healing spell. Living entities regain 1 hit point per hour of in-game time.

If you die during combat, after the battle you respawn with no items having forgotten one of your prepared spells of your choosing. If everyone in the party becomes unconscious or dies, the GM will pick a respawn point and time, and everyone wakes up with no items other than their spell books and _all_ their prepared spells forgotten.

Turn order during combat is set by rolling a d20: highest roll goes first. If you sneak up on someone, or they don‚Äôt notice you initiate a first attack, they are surprised. If already in combat, a surprised creature cannot target you with an action on its next turn. If your action initiates combat ("While we're all hidden in this invisibility field, I'll cast lightning bolt at that unsuspecting guard!"), a surprised creature skips its first turn of combat.

Some spells may be cast as a reaction to an action taken during another creature's turn. Some actions always succeed unless counteracted by something else using a reaction. Other spells have some randomness to their effectiveness and require rolling a d20 to determine the outcome, with various odds. All this will be noted on the spell description.

Spells and items will generally have a compositional structure, allowing them to be combined to produce different effects, and for new spells to be invented. This is documented in the spell system that's used, which will generally be revealed to the player over the course of multiple gaming sessions and is part of the fun. In a good spell system, players often have more capabilities than they realize, and power is gained not by defeating mindless baddies to gain "experience points" and "reach level 12", but simply by learning how to compose different effects.

Other than item mechanics and spell behaviors given in descriptions, any other world mechanics will be determined by the GM. Generally, any action that seems reasonable for the setting should yield some plausible result.

All players start with a beginner set of spells and items (set by the GM) and a number of spells and items.

### Stealth combat

Let's continue that session with Ned and Kaitlyn, who are sneaking through some underground passageway looking for an entrance to a vault. They're approaching a corner, and can see purple light coming from around the corner.

_GM:_ You could try peeking around the corner... but your head will have to poke out a bit and I'll say that if there's someone nearby who happens to be looking in that direction, they'll detect you with 50/50 odds and we'll roll for it.

_Kaitlyn:_ Hmm, can we hear anything?

_GM:_ It's quiet.

_Ned:_ Hmm, we should cast invisibility to be sure.

_Kaitlyn:_ Agree.

_GM:_ All right, you both cast invisibility. Every thirty feet you move you must roll a d20 >= 5 to maintain the invisibility.

_Ned:_ How far is the corner from us?

_GM:_ Only a few feet. You'll be able to get well around the corner before we roll for that.

_Kaitlyn:_ All right, I'll carefully walk to the corner and poke my head around to look toward the light source.

_GM:_ Okay, you see an elaborate carved door with intricate inlays, glowing purple. And in front of the door there is a faceless shadow figure. It doesn't detect you yet.

Ned and Kaitlyn discuss what to do. This is definitely the vault entrance, based on the description from the client. Ned recognizes the creature as a shadow sentry, and thinks they should try a touch of sunlight spell against it. It rarely has any defense against that prepared, and because they'll have the advantage of surprise, they'll get at least two attacks in before it can take any action, like alerting its controller. Kaitlyn is concerned about the purple glowing on the door, often associated with remote sensing magic--she wonders if someone else is observing this hallway through the door, or if someone will be able to sense the door being opened. They may have to move quickly.

_GM:_ Okay, you walk right up to the creature, an incorporeal shadow without clear form, and attack it. Since you're both invisible and moving silently, the creature is surprised. We'll roll turn order... it's Kaitlyn, the creature, then Ned, but since the creature is surprised we'll be skipping its first turn. Kaitlyn, what do you do?

_Kaitlyn:_ I cast touch of sunlight and lay my hands on the creature.

_GM:_ All right, touch of sunlight does 2 radiant damage to any creature that has shadow magic prepared. Roll d20 >= 5 to hit.

_Kaitlyn:_ 7!!

_GM:_ Okay, that's a success. Sunlight pulses through your fingers and into the creature. It grabs for your throat but then then dissipates to nothing. It's gone. You feel a shiver where you touched the creature.

_Ned:_ Yes!

_GM:_ Also, now that a turn has passed, you'll roll to maintain your invisibility - both are a success, so you're still invisible. Now what?

_Ned:_ Let's try the door.

_Kaitlyn:_ Wait, we should check it for traps. I don't think either of us has anything more specific than detect magic (Ned agrees), I'll swap detect magic for my touch of sunlight spell and cast it.

_GM:_ All right, cast detect magic. You can sense that the door has been enchanted with some sort of locking spell, but there's no other type of magic that you can detect.

_Ned:_ We can use the unlocking spell the client provided. I'll do it, you can keep detect magic active. I'll replace my common conjure spell since I'd like to keep touch of sunlight prepared.

_GM:_ All right, you try the unlocking spell, and the door slides open with a loud rumble, which makes you nervous. Inside is a small, dark room, almost a closet size, with some shelves. The shelves are empty except for a brightly glowing acquamarine crystal.

_Kaitlyn:_ That's gotta be it. What does my detect magic tell me?

_GM:_ This object is ancient, imbued with so many layers of magic it's hard to pinpoint which spells were used to create it. You think you detect hints of a common unlocking spell you've learned, but there's clearly much here that you've never been exposed to. It seems very powerful. What do you want to do?

_Ned:_ I'll pop it in my carrying pack.

_GM:_ All right, you pick up the crystal and place it in your pack. It's ice cold to the touch. You notice that it's glowing so brightly that its light is visible through the fabric of your pack and you're concerned your invisibility spell might not fully obscure it. And then, you hear something--footsteps, coming from around the corner where you were going to retrace your steps to exit. The door to the vault is still open. You have time for one turn each before the footsteps make it to the corner leading to your position, then we'll roll initiative. What do you do?

_Ned:_ I'm realizing we need to plan our exit strategies better for these heists... we should have a plan A and a plan B. You know, like professionals.

_Kaitlyn:_ We can discuss this later! I say no more hiding. I'm using my turn to prepare a stun bolt. Make yourself useful and prepare that boost lightning spell you learned so we can combo...

### Tactical combat

_GM:_ As your remove the spellbook from the pedestal in the center of this enormous cavern and toss it in your pack, you hear the soft pattering of a multitude of legs, and at least a hundred two foot wide spiders emerge from openings in the walls all around. You're surrounded, and the first of the horde will reach your position in 3 turns. Rolling initiative now - it'll be the spiders, then Ned, then Kaitlyn. What would you like to do?

_Kaitlyn:_ NOT GOOD.

_Ned:_ Gulp. I'm guessing they aren't very strong but there are way too many to deal with individually. We need some area effect. Any ideas?

_Kaitlyn:_ Fire might work well. We could raise a medium radius enclosing fireball and they'll ignite upon entering it. And then we can burstcast or maybe deep raycast some additional fire effects on top of that. We don't have enough turns to do that from scratch though. Got anything in crystal?

_Ned:_ Yes! I've got a couple small fire crystals in my pack. So on first turn, I'll fetch those, then you can thaw and grow it to medium size, then on next turn I'll prep a red manifold and you can cast the fireball.

_Kaitlyn:_ What if we miss the roll to grow the fire manifold?

_Ned:_ Hmm... then we're toast. And also, not all these things are going to ignite necessarily. It's d20 >= 7 for that. Even if only a dozen make it through, we'd be overwhelmed. And who's to say they'll just mindlessly march into the flames? Maybe they'll just wait until the fire winks out and then come in and devour us.

_Kaitlyn:_ Yeah, I don't like this plan. We can't just hang out here and hope for the best. It'd be a lot easier to deal with them in single file, in the tunnel we entered from. Could we make a run for it?

_GM:_ You're surrounded, so you'd definitely have to fight through a wave of spiders to reach that area.

_Ned:_ All right, what if we burstcast a fireball towards that exit to clear a path, then run for it?

_Kaitlyn:_ That's good! Assuming we make it, we can block the entrance with an ice barrier.

The two players discuss details of their plan, including who's doing what on each turn, and tell the GM. There's one crucial roll in the plan, to grow the fire manifold to medium size (requires d20 >= 6) before burstcasting it to clear an area around the exit.

_GM:_ Okay, sounds good. Kaitlyn, it's your roll.

_Kaitlyn:_ Okay, here goes... *rolls*.

_Ned:_ A natural 20!!! YESSSSSS!!!

_GM:_ This means you have the option to increase the fire manifold to large size before casting. Would you like to do that?

Kaitlyn: Hell yes.

_GM:_ All right, you expand the ball of flame in your hands until it's almost as large as your armspan, then project it rapidly toward the cavern exit in a column of fire. It explodes at its destination, producing an enormous expanding sphere of flames. Flaming spider legs and body parts fly apart from the epicenter of the blast. All the spiders in that area take 1 fire damage, and it kills them. The path is clear, and remaining spiders are 2 turns away, enough to make it to the exit.

_Kaitlyn:_ Epic!

Ned: Amazing. Let's run for it. While running, I'll ready the ice field to seal the exit, like we planned.

_GM:_ All right, you make it to the exit with the spiders close behind. Ned casts the ice barrier, blocking the entrance. The spiders reach the translucent sheet of ice but don't seem capable of the bludgeoning or other damage types that would be needed to shatter it. They seem to lose interest and retreat. You're out of combat now, but you should probably keep moving just to be safe.

_Kaitlyn:_ Sweet. Good teammwork.

_Ned:_ Likewise! ... I feel like now would be a bad time to sit and spend 5 minutes reading this spellbook we made out with, but I have to admit I'm extremely curious.

_Kaitlyn:_ Yeah, me too. Let's make it back to camp first, though. That was a close one. I feel like we could have been more prepared on horde defense and I'll bet there's some better strategies we could come up with.

_Ned:_ Totally. I might have some ideas...

## Why? Design goals and considerations

Coevolution is simple to learn and administer: you can play it with just a single d20, a pencil and paper, and a 19x19 grid (a Go board works well for this) without special software. There's no complex character sheets or ability score improvements, and during battle, there's no calculations to do ("oop, I need to add my proficency bonus, but also I'm -3 due to the effects of the poison, and then I get to roll an extra d6 since it's my first turn of combat, and it's a Tuesday and... wait, what was I doing again?"). At its most basic form, the game consists solely of learning more spells and acquiring items, and the only character state is the number of hit points and the set of spells (which can be prepared, known, or recorded) and a small set of items held in your pack.

The system generates gameplay and creativity without lots of rules or complexity, but by simple rules designed for emergent behavior. In this sense, it draws inspiration from games such as Go or Backgammon, which have tremendous depth yet are simple to learn. Stripped of its role-playing elements, it is entirely possible to play Coevolution contests without a GM, much like Go, Chess, or Backgammon (and this might even be fun).

In Coevolution, creativity arises from a small set of interesting spells that can interact with each other and the world in multiple ways, and by allowing for these spells to be prepared dynamically. Character specialization emerges naturally over time, but rather than a complicated character sheet with two dozen different abilitiy scores, a list of feats, and so on, players have only ongoing decisions about what spells to remember and prepare (and what spells you leave archived away in your spell book for the day you decide you need relearn them).

Combat in Coevolution is varied, brief, and intense, as shown in the example session excerpts. Spells often interact, so cooperation between players and planning of combat makes a big difference. Battles can also evolve, since combatants can swap out spells during combat (at a cost of one turn) and even special-purpose spells can find good usage. But because each player maxes out at 5 hit points, every turn counts and it pays to have the right spells prepared up front. Thus, reconnaisance, planning, and good use of stealth can turn the outcome of a battle.

Death is more common in Coevolution, but the revival mechanism means it's more of a learning opportunity. Death is boring when it's random and it means repeating the same gameplay again. But when each death teaches something and gives you ideas about how to approach the battle next time, that can be fun and welcome breather between chapters of gaming ("that horde of spiders overwhelmed our defenses, and picking them off one at a time won't work, what else can we try?").

Coevolution tries to avoid a few aspects of other RPG systems that aren't always fun:

* The "hitpoint mountain", where some battle outcomes are almost predetermined (due to one side or the other being more powerful), but it still takes an hour of mostly repetitive actions before it's resolved. And everyone around the table can sense this, making it less fun than it could be.
* The consequences of death are so high that GMs create easier and more predictable battles they know the players can win (and the players know this also, making it less exciting). In Coevolution, it's totally fine for battle outcomes to be uncertain: both the players and the GM can learn and be surprised by them, and that's part of the fun.
* "This spell could be useful here, but I don't want to use it now, in case I need it more later or need that spell slot for something more important later." In Coevolution, there's generally no limit on the number of times spells can be cast (unless specifically noted in the spell's description), so you can play every situation like it's your last. Likewise, the GM can create situations that require this YOLO style play to be successful.
* "I'm not even going to bother learning or preparing this special purpose or situational spell, since I don't know what I'll encounter today and need those slots for spells more likely to be applicable." You might not keep a conjure cinamon roll spell prepared all the time, and you wouldn't take that over some more generic damage-dealing spell, but isn't it satisfying to find a reason to use a spell like this? (Perhaps someone you need to curry favor with someone who really likes cinamon rolls...)
* For GMs, it's complicated and a lot of work to construct detailed maps (increasing the cost of creating new content for the game's universe), and for players, the extra detail and the forced precision about positions and distances isn't always relevant or interesting. Using more abstract situation maps and coarse grained notions of distances is easier for players to reason about and easier for GMs to administer, and can be just as immersive.
