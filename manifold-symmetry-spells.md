# Manifold Symmetry, Vol ▵ ∙ Principles of Casting

_Revision_  ❅  ⌁  ⦿  ▵

> __Scribe’s note:__ My name is Reva. The original from which I am attempting this replication spell is already a degraded partial that descends into scrambled nonsense. A small inscription on the inside cover of the original states that canonicals are maintained in the city of Topos, and any mage may travel there and [contribute to subsequent revisions](https://github.com/pchiusano/coevolution/edit/main/manifold-symmetry-spells.md), published regularly. The mages of Topos almost certainly had techniques to prevent such degredation, but they are unknown to me. Still, it is a gift to have found any means of mass replication of this work.

### Prelude

Before The Founders initiated the rationalization of magic hundreds of years ago, spells were discovered largely at random, without understanding of their compositional structure. The process was ad hoc rather than systematic, and shrouded in much unhelpful secrecy, mysticism and superstition. All this greatly limited development of the field and relegated magic to a more minor role in civilization. Spellbooks from this unenlightened period might contain an overly complex spell to conjure a loaf of bread (with some nonsense commentary that the spell would work only during a full moon), yet give no inkling of how to conjure bread dough! Or for a hundred years, the spell for summoning fog was known, but not the method of casting a jet of water, despite the spells being composed from the same enriched manifold in fieldcast and raycast forms!

The Founders sought to uncover the principles of casting through systemic study and experimentation. After being initially laughed at, they advanced well beyond the brutish, unreasoning forms of magic, which led ultimately to the foundation of Topos, our great city and the wonder of all the world.

### Chapter ▵ ∙ _Pure Elemental Casting_

Know that mages do not _create_ magic; they merely direct and shape that which suffuses our reality. Five elemental magics exist: __Red ▵__ (that of fire and blood), __Amber ⌁__ (that of lightning and thunder), __Green ◧__ (that of earth, stone, and magnetism), __Blue ❆__ (that of water, ice, and fog), and __Violet ꩜__ (that of illusion and the folding of reality). The elementals are often drawn as points on the pentagon or pentagram, to emphasize symmetries and dualities we will introduce shortly.

Without a mage to direct these forces, they are too diffuse and randomized to do useful work. Thus the most fundamental of casts is singularity formation, which summons a point manifold of an elemental type. For beginners, this is often done with a closed fist and intense concentration; for experienced mages it is as easy and rapid as blinking. Once formed, and with sustained concentration, the point will grow to a larger manifold, which has corresponding greater power but less stability.

> __Scribe’s note:__ When I was just a little girl and  knew nothing of the existence of magic, one day at dusk my brother and I were playing hide-and-seek outside. It getting dark, and I had looked everywhere else besides the barn, a place my brother knew frightened me at night—but I would not let him win. As I walked to the barn entrance, fists balled up in determination, I felt my right hand crackle with something like hot pins and needles. What’s this? I opened my hand to examine it. Floating there was a shimmering red pinpoint of light.
>
> While I watched, the pinpoint grew, as if drawing a red energy from the ether, until it was as large as a marble and I could see shifting folds on its surface, and then I heard my brother’s voice call my name. I looked up and he was at the window of the barn, staring at me with his mouth agape. Then I looked back at my hand and the strange surface I had summoned was dissipating.

<a id="singularity"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Form Singularity : </b> Create a marble-sized manifold of an elemental magic type.
</summary>

Takes 1 action and requires a free hand. There are separate spells for each elemental type (Red, Amber, Green, Blue, Violet). ⬠
</details>

<a id="grow"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Grow Manifold : </b> Grow the size of any manifold, increasing its power for subsequent casting.
</summary>

Size may be increased from singularity to small (requires d20 >= 2) or small to medium (requires d20 >= 6). On d20 = 20, you can grow the manifold two sizes (from singularity to medium, or small to large) and this is the only way of creating a large manifold via this spell. Medium manifolds require two hands to manipulate and keep stable; small and point manifolds can be controlled with one hand. On a failed roll, the spell has no effect. This may also be cast as a reaction for another willing creature next to you, but a failed roll causes the manifold to dissipate. Point manifolds are silent; small or larger manifolds make a sound like the resonant vibration of a wind chime. ⬠
</details>

<a id="dissipate"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Dissipate Manifold : </b> Fully or partially dissipate a manifold.</summary>

The manifold must be one you or a willing being next to you controls. You may reduce its size to anything less than its current size (or to 0, in which case it no longer exists or occupies a hand). This may also be cast as a reaction. ⬠
</details>

<a id="divide"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Divide Manifold : </b> Separate a manifold you control into two manifolds of the same type.
</summary>

The combined size of the resulting two manifolds equals that of the original. For example, a medium red manifold may be split into one red singularity and one small red manifold. As this results in an extra manifold, it requires a free hand or a willing person next to you to take one of the halves produced by this spell. This may also be cast as a reaction for another willing being next to you. ⬠
</details>

Any manifold may be stabilized in crystal for storage and later use. This is done by first slowing its natural shifting. Once halted, a cloudy crystal encrusts in layers over the frozen manifold, obscuring much of its light. It is now safe to store away. The manifold may be reactivated rapidly by unfreezing its core; this cracks and sloughs away the crystalline crust to reveal the original manifold, ready for use.

<a id="crystallize"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Crystallize : </b> Convert a manifold to its crystalline form for storage and later use.
</summary>

Once created, the crystal is silent, emits a dull light, and uses an item slot. ⬠
</details>

<a id="decrystallize"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Decrystallize : </b> Convert a crystalline manifold back to its active form, suitable for casting.
</summary>
This takes one turn. See <a href="#quick-decrystallize">Quick Decrystallize</a>. ⬠
</details>

<a id="quick-decrystallize"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Quick Decrystallize : </b> Allow decrystallization to be prepared on the same turn as another action.</summary>

Ordinarily, decrystallization takes a full turn, but keeping this spell prepared means it can be done at the start of a turn, before another action (like casting the decrystallized manifold). This spell must be prepared alongside <a href="#decrystallize">Decrystallize</a>. Quick decrystallization cannot be performed as part of a reaction. ⬠
</details>

A manifold is but a precursor to other casting. We first consider the various _universal modes_ of casting, which are methods of directing or releasing the energy of any manifold. The effects of any universal mode of casting will depend on the manifold type, and these effects will be noted as we introduce other manifold types.

The first universal mode _rupturing_, barely a cast at all but simply uncontrolled release of a manifold’s energy. It is often performed accidentally by starting casters!

<a id="rupture"></a>
<details>
<summary>📖 <b>Rupture : </b> Allow a manifold of any type under your control to explosively rupture.</summary>

Unless otherwise noted for the manifold type, ruptured singularities do 1 point of damage only to you. Small manifolds deal 1 damage to you and all beings next to you, medium manifolds deal 2 damage to you and 1 damage to all other beings a short distance away, and large manifolds deal 3 damage to you and 1 damage to all other beings a medium distance away. ⬠
</details>

A more useful effect is _tapcasting_, which directs the elemental energy of a manifold into a person or object within reach. To tapcast, concentrate to condense the manifold, then close your fist over it and rapidly move your fist to the target, opening your palm outward at the last moment and initiating a rupture. The manifold will explosively transfer into the target.

<a id="tapcast"></a>
<details>
<summary>📖 <b>Tapcast : </b> Rapid high-energy transfer of a manifold into an entity within reach. </summary>

The entity must be next to you (or be you). Requires d20 >= 10 if the target is alive, aware of your presence, and attempts to avoid you, otherwise it always succeeds. Unless otherwise noted for the manifold type, tapcast singularities do 1 point of damage to their target, small manifolds deal 2 damage to their target, and larger manifolds cannot be tapcast. ⬠
</details>

A related universal mode is _raycasting_, which projects a manifold as a beam of elemental energy. With palm facing out, initiate a rupture, then quickly focus to condense the exploding manifold just behind its center. A powerful comet-shaped beam directs outward some distance before it dissipates. Raycasting is a universal mode of directing the magic of any manifold, and later we will consider more complex fused and enriched manifolds which have other effects when raycast.

Raycasting may also be used to remotely rupture a manifold or crystalline manifold, though it requires great accuracy.

<a id="raycast"></a>
<details>
<summary>📖 <b>Raycast : </b> Asymmetrically rupture a manifold to produce a beam of directed magical energy.
</summary>

Raycast manifolds must be larger than point-sized (singularities are too weak to raycast) and under your control. The resulting beam travels rapidly in a straight line toward a target of your choice that you can see up to a medium distance away. The beam is stopped by solid objects or upon hitting a living being.

Unless otherwise noted for a manifold type, other raycast manifolds have the following effect: on hitting a target (requires d20 >= 8 to hit a medium or larger target, such as another person, d20 >= 18 to hit a small target, and d20 = 20 to hit a tiny target), a small manifold deals 1 damage, a medium manifold deals 2 damage, and a large manifold deals 3 damage. If the target is another manifold, a hit <a href="#rupture">ruptures</a> it. ⬠
</details>

<a id="deep-raycast"></a>
<details>
<summary>📖 <b>Deep Raycast : </b> Upgrade <a href="#raycast">Raycast</a> to pass through and hit multiple targets.</summary>

Must be prepared alongside <a href="#raycast">Raycast</a> to have an effect. When prepared, raycasting is upgraded with the ability to pass through beings (but not solid objects) and hit any number of entities that fall in a straight line from its origin. Useful when multiple enemies are approaching in single file. Can be combined with <a href="#distance-raycast">Distance Raycast</a>. ⬠
</details>

<a id="distance-raycast"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Distance Raycast : </b> Upgrade <a href="#raycast">Raycast</a> to hit targets at longer distances.</summary>

Must be prepared alongside <a href="#raycast">Raycast</a> to have an effect. When prepared, you may choose to have raycasts travel up to a far distance in a straight line from its origin. Can be combined with <a href="#deep-raycast">Deep Raycast</a>. ⬠
</details>

<a id="burstcast"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Burstcast : </b>  Upgrade <a href="#raycast">Raycast</a> to create an explosive <a href="#rupture">rupture</a> upon hitting a target.</summary>

Must be prepared alongside <a href="#raycast">Raycast</a> to have an effect. When prepared, you may choose to have raycasts of a manifold M act like a <a href="#rupture">rupture</a> of M when they hit their target. Such casts may be combined with <a href="#distance-raycast">Distance Raycast</a> ) but not <a href="#deep-raycast">Deep Raycast</a>. ⬠
</details>

The final universal mode of casting is _fieldcasting_, which expands a manifold over a diffuse area, creating a field of magic. This requires concentration to maintain. It has little use for the pure elemental manifolds, but can have powerful effects when used as a casting mode for the more complex fused and transformed manifolds we consider next. For instance, certain fieldcast manifolds can dissipate a ray that results from raycasting before it reaches its target.

<a id="fieldcast"></a>
<details>
<summary>📖 <b>Fieldcast : </b> Create a field of effect by expand a manifold you control over a large area.</summary>

The input manifold must be larger than singularity-sized. Small fieldcast manifolds extends only far enough to cover you and anyone next to you. Medium fieldcast manifolds extend a short distance, and large fieldcast manifolds extend a medium distance.

Unless otherwise noted for a manifold type, the field follows you as you move, and is too diffuse to have any effect. Requires d20 >= 7 at the start of each subsequent turn to maintain. On a failed roll, it dissipates. ⬠
</details>

#### Duality and Fusing

So far we have discussed only _simple_ manifolds, composed of just a single elemental type.  Placing each of the elemental magics on the points of a pentagon, in the order Red, Amber, Green, Blue, Violet, we say adjacent elements are _consonant_ and non-adjacent elements are _dual_. Thus, Green is consonant with Amber and Blue, but dual to Red and Violet. Manifolds of consonant types may be _fused_, by simply putting them in contact with one another (whereas manifolds of dual types dissipate when put in contact).

The fusing process can be repeated multiple times to eventually produce a __Light ⦿__ manifold containing all five elemental types. These glow brighly the color of sunlight.

<a id="fuse"></a>
<details>
<summary>📖 <b>Fuse : </b> Combine any two consonant manifolds to form a composite manifold.</summary>

Requires a successful (d20 >= 5), and can be performed on combine any two consonant manifolds that you control (or a willing being next to you controls). On a failed d20 >= 5, this has no effect. If the manifolds being fused are themselves composite, they are considered consonant with one another if at least one of their constituent element types are consonant. The size of a fused manifold is the sum of their sizes (point = 1, small = 2, medium = 3, large = 4), but if the resulting size exceeds 4, it ruptures. ⬠

The field of a fieldcast composite manifold with elements _E_ will dissipate any <a href="#raycast">raycasts</a> passing through, so long as the duals of that ray are all contained in _E._ For example, a Violet/Red field dissipates a Green raycast (since Green is dual to Red and Violet). A Violet/Red/Amber field dissipates both Green and Blue raycasts (since Green is dual to Red and Violet, and Blue is dual to Red and Amber). And a Light manifold field will dissipate all raycasts, including itself!
</details>

The calculus of dissipation leads to a commonly derived means of detecting elemental magic: simply create a weakened manifold that dissipates upon contact with dual elements.

<a id="detect-magic"></a>
<details>
<summary>📖 <b>Detect Magic : </b> Detect elemental types of magic used nearby.</summary>

This convert a manifold M to one that when cast, detects the presence of magic of all types dual to the elemental types used by M.

For instance, a Red manifold may be converted to a detection manifold that when fieldcast, reveals whether Blue or Green magic is being used within the field (or it may be raycast to query remote objects). An object is considered to use an elemental type if it is <a href="#enchant">enchanted</a> or <a href="#charge">charged</a> with some spell, and a living being is considered to use an elemental if it holds an active or crystalline manifolds that use that elemental. ⬠
</details>

For any simple elemental manifold, _dualizing_ converts its elemental type to either one of its duals. Within the nucleus of each manifold are the precursors of its duals. Either of these precursors may be gently focused on and expanded to transition the overal manifold to the dual elemental type, which has the effect of shrinking the original elemental type back into the nucleus. We note that through dualization, from any starting elemental manifold, we can obtain any other in at most two steps.

<a id="dualize"></a>
<details><summary>
📖 <b>Dualize : </b> Convert any simple manifold (of a single elemental type) to one of its duals.</summary>

Red can be turned Green or Blue, Amber may be turned Blue or Violet, Green may be turned Violet or Red, Blue may be turned Red or Amber, and Violet may be turned Amber or Green. ⬠
</details>

Fieldcasting may be improved to either absorb or deflect incoming raycasts. This is often used to mount counterattacks.

<a id="absorb"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Absorb : </b> Converts any manifold, M, to one that, when <a href="#fieldcast">fieldcast</a>, will crystallize rays it would otherwise dissipate.
</summary>

When raycast, an absorbtion manifold will crystallize any dual manifolds it strikes. In all other respects it behaves like M. ⬠
</details>

<a id="deflect"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Deflect : </b> converts a manifold, M, to one that, when fieldcast, will raycast back to the sender rays that M would dissipate.</summary>

You may choose not to deflect incoming rays. In all other respects, a deflection manifold on M behaves like M. ⬠
</details>

While the mage may cast manifolds directly, the magic of any manifold may also be suffused temporarily into inert objects, allowing them to take on magical properties. While artificing is a complex subject, _enchantment_ and _charging_ are its two most basic forms, considered equal in importance to the other universal modes such as fieldcasting.

<a id="enchant"></a>
<details><summary>
📖 <b>Enchant: </b> Consume a manifold, M to create a magical artifact surrounded by a field.</summary>

Touch any object the same size or smaller than M. The object acts as if it has a fieldcast M field covering its surface. For instance, enchanting a shield with an <a href="#absorb">Absorb</a> manifold will cause the shield to absorb raycasts that strike it. This field will remain active on d20 >= 5. ⬠
</details>

<a id="charge"></a>
<details><summary>
📖 <b>Charge Artifact: </b> Consumes a manifold, M to create a magical artifact that will release a manifold's energy on contact.</summary>

Touch any object the same size or smaller than M. The object will act as if <a href="#tapcast">tapcasting</a> M when it next strikes something. ⬠
</details>

This concludes our first chapter. What has just been covered thus far is known as _pure elemental casting_, or sometimes _elementalism_. Although elementalism has undeniable beauty, the subject is limited in its applications and has by this point been exceedingly well-studied. (See some of the commentated transcriptions of open plane contests in Appendix ▵, or consult the text _Pure Elemental Contests on Open and Complex Planes_ for a thorough treatment.) Its symmetry is a source of beauty but also sameness, and most work today is in the development of various _enrichments_ to the basic elemental forms.

### Chapter  ⌁  ∙ _An Introduction to Enriched Manifolds_

_Enrichment_ is the process of augmenting a manifold with additional properties beyond its pure elemental composition. There exist an enormous variety of enriched manifolds that can be constructed, but here we will introduce the _primary enriched forms_ of each elemental magic type, starting with Blue manifolds (which may be enriched to [Water](#water) and subsequently [Ice](#freeze)) and Red (which may be enriched to [Fire](#fire) and related forms). Later we'll consider Amber enrichment to create lightning, Green enrichment to form kinesis manifolds for moving rock and earth, and Violet enrichment to create the most basic form of invisibility, that based on the bending of light.

Unlike pure elemental casting, which mages are often able to perform without deliberate effort, learning enriched forms well enough to subsequently cast requires intense concentration that can only be achieved during deep sleep. In principle, learning spells requires only mentally attuning to the spells before sleep, but this process is still not well understood despite extensive study. Mages at times report difficulty learning new spells and find themselves subject to peculiar dreams whose outcomes affect learning of the spell. Some famous spells (such as quickbind) have been recorded for generations, but only ever learned by a handful of mages.

<a id="learn-spell"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Learn Spell : </b> To learn a spell that has been recorded in your spellbook requires a full night's rest.</summary>

You can learn up to 2 spells each night. Some spells are considered difficult for you to learn and the GM may present you with a dream scenario which must be overcome to successfully learn the spell. ⬠
</details>

<a id="water"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Water : </b> Convert a Blue manifold to a Water Manifold.</summary>

The input manifold must be one that you control (or a willing being next to you controls). When cast, it extinguishes any flames at the target but does no damage. Water manifolds may also be raycast or tapcast as a reaction to eliminate any fire damage to the target before it occurs.

When <a href="#fieldcast">fieldcast</a>, water manifolds deals no damage, but produce dense fog that makes you invisible to any beings except those next to you, and likewise prevents you from seeing anyone not beside you. Unlike most fieldcast manifolds, the fog does not follow your person; it stays centered where it is cast. The fog can also extinguish any flames within its area on successful d20 >= 12. This roll is done once at the start of your turn. ⬠
</details>

<a id="freeze"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Freeze : </b> Convert a <a href="#water">Water</a> manifold to an Ice Manifold.</summary>

The input manifold W must be controlled by you or a willing being next to you. When cast, this manifold deals the same damage as a Blue elemental manifold, but as cold damage. Furthermore, on hit, targets are frozen on d20 >= 4 and cannot take reactions until their turn, and if the same d20 >= 4 roll exceeds 18, the target is additionally unable to move until your next turn. Having this spell prepared makes you immune to cold damage.

When <a href="#fieldcast">fieldcast</a>, Ice manifolds form a blue-tinted clear surface of ice that beings cannot move through, but it otherwise behaves like a Blue elemental field. The ice barrier does not move with your person and shatters upon receiving 1 hitpoint of damage of any type except Blue elemental damage. ⬠
</details>


<a id="fire"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Fire : </b> Convert a Red manifold to a Fire manifold.</summary>

The input manifold R must be controlled by you or a willing being next to you. A Fire manifold on R behaves like R but deals fire damage, and ignites the target(s) on d20 >= 7. The target(s) burn as long as you continue to roll d20 >= 7 at the start of your subsequent turns. An ignited target takes 1 fire damage on each of its turns. Having this spell prepared makes you immune to fire damage.

When <a href="#fieldcast>fieldcast</a>, Fire manifolds do no direct damage but create an enclosing field of flame that can ignite beings inside it. Unlike other manifold types, fire fields do not move with your person but remains centered where cast. ⬠
</details>

<a id="lightning"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Lightning : </b> Convert an Amber manifold A to a Lightning manifold.</summary>

The input manifold A must be controlled by you or a willing being next to you. The Lightning manifold behaves like A, except that it deals lightning damage, and always behaves as if <a href="#deep-raycast">Deep Raycast</a> even when that spell is unprepared. It also transmits along metal and on hit, does an extra 1 damage against beings carrying medium or larger metallic objects. ⬠
</details>

<a id="forked-lightning"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Forked Lightning : </b> Upgrades <a href="#lightning">Lightning</a> to split lightning bolts and hit multiple targets.</summary>

<p>
When prepared alongside <a href="#lightning">Lightning</a>, raycasts of Lightning manifolds can choose multiple targets that are within a short distance of one another. ⬠
</details>

<a id="pull"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Kinesis (Pull) : </b> Pull objects of stone and earth toward your position.</summary>

<p>
Converts a Green manifold G that you control (or a willing being next to you controls) to a Kinesis Manifold. When <a href="#raycast">Raycast</a> and upon hitting an object whose size is below that of G and which is made of stone or earth, the object may be pulled toward you as a reaction and held afloat at your position. Objects thus pulled will reach your position (or any position along a straight line to the object) at the start of your next turn. Kinesis manifolds deal no damage when cast and cannot be dissipated by fields. ⬠
</details>

<a id="fling"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Kinesis (Fling) : </b> Launch objects held with <a href="#pull">Kinesis</a> as projectiles.</summary>

<p>
Requires having <a href="#pull">Kinesis (Pull)</a> prepared. Objects held can be launched as projectiles that travel a medium distance and deal damage upon striking targets. Tiny objects deal 1 damage, small objects deal 2 damage, medium objects deal 3 damage, and large objects deal 4 damage. The damage type is either bludgeoning or piercing damage, depending on the sharpness of the pulled object. ⬠
</details>

<a id="projectile-pull"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Kinesis (Projectile Pull) : </b> Create projectiles by rapidly pulling objects toward your position.</summary>

<p>
Requires having <a href="#pull">Kinesis (Pull)</a> prepared. Objects pulled become projectiles that deal damage upon striking targets. The damage amount is the same as the equivalent raycast pure elemental spell, but the damage is either bludgeoning or piercing damage, depending on the sharpness of the pulled object. ⬠
</details>

<a id="invisibility"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Invisibility : </b> Convert a Violet manifold to an Invisibility manifold.</summary>

<p>
When <a href="#fieldcast">fieldcast</a>, beings within the field are invisible to those outside the field and cannot be directly targeted by raycasts or other targeted effects. When raycast or tapcast, objects smaller than the source manifold are made invisible, with a local surface field that remains active as long as you roll d20 >= 7 on each subsequent turn. Invisibility may also be raycast as a reaction to obscure the casting of another manifold from view. ⬠
</details>

These are only the most basic enriched manifolds. In later chapters we will begin study of more interesting enriched forms, used to create effects such as acidification, raybending, the rich tapestry of reality folding spells such as portals and observation orbs, as well as healing and revival spells. Notably, it was the basic revival spell which facilitated the enjoyable spectacle of magical contests that has become an inseparable part of Topos culture: death during battle was eliminated as a concern, enabling participants to play at their limits.

### Chapter ◧ ∙ _An Introduction to Metamagic_

Metamagic is sometimes considered the foundation of our field. It is one thing to uncover the principles of casting and various compositions of effects, but metamages give these compositions names and repeatable forms such that they can be recorded and taught. Metamagic is itself a rich field of study, discussed in later volumes, but its most common primitives are _bind_ and _quickbind_, which create new types of spells by combinations of existing effects. Metamages capable of mastering these spells are uncommon.

<a id="bind"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Bind : </b> Bind records a new spell from any sequence of N turns you can take alone.</summary>

<p>
When cast, at most once per day, choose a name for the bound spell; the new spell is considered to be recorded but unlearned. You can learn it during sleep like any other spell. Its casting time, manifold requirements, and effects of the spell remain the same (including any randomness in its execution), but this can be used to save on prepared spell slots. For instance, one might bind the sequence of steps that leads to creation of a medium crystalline <a href="#water">Water</a> manifold. ⬠
</details>

<a id="quickbind"></a>
<details><summary>📖 <b>Quickbind : </b> Like <a href="#bind">Bind</a>, but succeeds only on d20 >= 15, and the resulting spell executes in a single turn.</summary>

After each usage of the created spell, roll a d20 >= 10 or else unprepare the spell. This is an exceedingly difficult <a href="#learn-spell">spell to learn</a>. Spells created with quickbind cannot be shared with other mages. ⬠
</details>

Desipite its limitations, the use of [Quickbind](#quickbind) fundamentally alters the nature of both open and complex plane contests. Powerful compositions that would require excessive casting times become available for immediate use, altering the landscape of strategies and invalidating most opening books.
