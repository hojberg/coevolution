# Manifold Symmetry

Manifold Symmetry is a fantasy setting for the [Coevolution](overview.md) role-playing system. You can optionally read [Manifold Symmetry, Vol ‚ñµ](manifold-symmetry-spells.md) if you're curious about its spell system, or just sit back and enjoy the game's introductory scenario: an unusual heist you will execute collaboratively and which functions as a tutorial for the game's mechanics.

The world of Manifold Symmetry is an alternate pre-industrial history many generations after the unexplained disappearance of Topos, a floating city home to a utopian society of mages that made advanced use of magic.

While magic still exists in the present, it is rare, underpowered, and in decline. Fewer mages are born each year, they develop seemingly fewer abilities, and to the extent anyone gives the matter any thought, it's presumed this decline will continue until magic no longer exists. As magic has no future, most folk are incurious about the subject. The stories of Topos and its advanced mage society seem mythical, unreal, and disconnected from the current reality.

You play a thief with some limited magical abilities, living in the warm coastal city of Azranta. It's a bustling place a few days travel to the striking canyons created where the floating islands of Topos were raised from the earth by its Founders.

When the story begins, you (or another player) will volunteer to play a scene at Geppo's Curiosities, a mid-city shop you do business with regularly. The shop owner Geppo almost certainly understands the items you sell him are stolen, but he doesn't ask questions and pays reasonable prices. He's a calm, elderly man; you aren't close but you've grown accustomed to his reliable presence and fair dealings and perhaps bear him some affection.

It is the day after a successful night of work and you have a few pieces of stolen jewelry to sell. You enter the shop, shuffle past a few customers and say hello to Geppo. He seems nervous, and after your business is complete, he slips you a note. This is highly unusual. The note says to assemble a crew you trust and meet him at the northern docks after nightfall, to meet a client who has requested your services...

## For players

What is your character's name? What is their relationship to the other characters?

Other questions to spark character ideas: How did your character first learn of their abilities? How did they become a theif? What motivates your character? What are their hopes and dreams? Is your character solemn or a joker? Aggressive or peaceful? Social or a recluse? Can you share an anecdote from their everyday life? Besides covering basic needs, what does your character like to do with their modest earnings?

## Starting inventory and spells

All players begin with the same set of spells:

* __Lesser Invisibility :__, you are completely silent and invisible, and the effect is maintained for subsequent turns (or every far distance traveled) as long as you roll d20 >= 8. Requires 4 turns to cast.
* __Touch of Sleep :__ forces sleep on a surprised enemy within reach, with various odds of success depending on the situation and the enemy.
* __Darkvision :__ when prepared, you can see in the dark

You are also a skilled climber and carry with you a [dagger](#dagger), [lockpicking tools](#lockpicking-tools), and 5 gold pieces.

<a id="dagger"></a>
<details><summary>‚öîÔ∏è  <b>Dagger : </b> Basic melee attack weapon</summary>

Deal 1 slashing damage to an enemy within reach on d20 >= 10, or for a surprised enemy, a d20 >= 3 deals 4 slashing damage.
</details>

<a id="lockpicking-tools"></a>
<details><summary>ü™õ  <b>Lockpicking tools : </b> Can be used to open locks without needing the key.</summary>

Counts as a small item. Requires 4 turns to use. The odds of success will depend on the lock, and the GM will tell you these odds in advance.
</details>

## How to play

To play, you'll need at least one 20-sided dice (_d20_ for short), an 18 x 18 grid (a Go board works well for this if playing in person), and a sheet of paper for each player to track their hit points (a number 0-5), spell set (recorded, known, and prepared), and items (held or stowed). When playing over the internet, the setup can be as simple as a Google Doc with different sections for each player's character sheet, and an [ascii art grid](#grids) done in a monospaced font.

The grid or some subset of it is sometimes used in time-sensitive situations like combat, where turns and distances are tracked carefully, or to help visualize the layout of some environment. In these situations, on each turn, players can move up to 3 non-diagonal steps on this grid. When spells and effects discuss distances, they are kept abstract ("within reach" is in one of the 4 adjacent non-diagonal positions, "a short distance away" is at most 3 steps away, "medium distance" is up to 6 steps away, "far away" is up to 12 steps away, and "very far away" is anything more than that).

## Appendix 1: Grids

These are handy for creating low tech maps of an area if playing online and you don't want to bother with a more complicated platform like [Roll20](https://roll20.net). Players and NPCs can be placed and moved around on the map by replacing the `+` with a unique letter or symbol representing them. The map can be placed in a shared doc and updated in real time by players, or the GM can screen share and accept directives like "I'll move to j16".
